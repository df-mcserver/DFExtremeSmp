# DFExtremeSmp
An experimental and incomplete [PaperMC](https://papermc.io/) plugin (1.21.3), for making survival harder.

> [!WARNING]
> NOT INTENDED FOR PERSONAL USE  
> This plugin is no-where near completion, it is a simple fork of [DFSmpPlus](https://github.com/df-mcserver/DFSmpPlus) from earlier in development.  
> Do not expect anything from this plugin, it is merely a proof-of-concept for an idea I had.
